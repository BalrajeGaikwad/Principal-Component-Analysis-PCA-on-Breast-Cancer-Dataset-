Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Breast Cancer Dataset! ðŸ“Š


I recently implemented PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on the well-known Breast Cancer dataset to explore dimensionality reduction and its impact on model performance. ðŸš€

âœ… Key Highlights:
ðŸ”¹ Reduced high-dimensional data while preserving essential patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Improved computational efficiency for machine learning models.
ðŸ”¹ Visualized how PCA transforms data into principal components.

This technique is crucial for feature selection, noise reduction, and better model generalization. Let me know your thoughts or experiences with PCA!
